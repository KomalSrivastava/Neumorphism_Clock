Neumorphism Clock is a design concept that combines minimalism with a sense of three-dimensions in the form of buttons and other elements.

Neumorphic elements sit right on top of the background surface and are usually a raised shape made from a very similar material to the background.

The color of the element is either the same or subtly different from the background surface. 

 The only thing that defines its shape is its shadows, created using multiple box-shadows in CSS.
