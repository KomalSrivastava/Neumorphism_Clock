* Neumorphism Clock is a design concept that combines minimalism with a sense of three-dimensions in the form of buttons and other elements.

* Neumorphic elements sit right on top of the background surface and are usually a raised shape made from a very similar material to the background.

* The color of the element is either the same or subtly different from the background surface. 

* The only thing that defines its shape is its shadows, created using multiple box-shadows in CSS.
